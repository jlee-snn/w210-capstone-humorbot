Then she said, Tomorrow I want you to get a towel and our big radio and go lie out on the beach. Then we can find out what shes really doing.Well, the plan went off without a hitch, and the wife was almost hopping up and down with anticipation when she saw the girl talk to her husband and then leave. The man walked up the beach and met his wife at the road. Well, is she selling drugs she asked excitedly.No, shes not. he said, enjoying this probably more than he should have.Well, what is it, then his wife fairly shrieked.The man grinned and said.

666,The ultimate Dad Joke  Bulgarian Train Man,"This has been my favourite joke for at least a couple years now.A man drives train in Bulgaria. One day, he falls asleep driving, and runs over someone walking on the tracks. Well, his case goes to court, and he gets the death sentence for murder. So, hes on death row and the executioner approaches him.What would you like for your last mealI would like a banana please.The executioner thinks its weird, but shrugs and gives him a banana. The guy eats his banana, waits awhile, and gets strapped into the electric chair. When the flip the switch, nothing happens In Bulgaria, an act of divine intervention means you get released.A few months go by, and the train driver has been working for a new company. Well, old habits die hard, and he falls asleep again, killing 2 people this time. The court has no patience for recklessness, so he ends up on death row again. After awhile, the same executioner from last time approaches him.You again Shit. What do you want this timeTwo bananas please.The executioner shrugs and hands him two bananas. A bit weird, but whatever. Theres no way he can cheat death twice But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again. The train driver walks a second time.Some time passes, and the executioner is very busy. After another few months, the same dude shows up, apparently having run over 3 people with a train. Exacberated, the executioner approaches him for the third time.",1 year ago,10500
