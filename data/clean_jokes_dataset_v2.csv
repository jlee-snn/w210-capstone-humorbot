"My son said he wanted a DVD on Religion, so I got him one.","Then he said he wanted a tricycle, so I got him one.Then, a few weeks later, he said he wanted a poster of Will Smith's face, so I got him one.The next day he said he wanted a coffee machine. I was getting irate now. But hey, I thought, if I get him this hopefully that will be the end.I was wrong. So very wrong. On the same day he said he wanted a caterpillar costume. Reluctantly, I got him one. Secondhand.Then he said he wanted something for a friend, a new pair of underwear. I had no idea why he would be giving his friend underwear, and I knew he only wanted them for himself. But hey, I thought, I don't want him to defecate on his clothes, so I got him some.After that, he approached me, and I was on the verge of an outburst. What do you want this time? I asked him. A sword? A sandwich? A three-headed dog? He said, no, he didn't want any of those things. Except the three-headed dog and the sword and the sandwich.Look, I said, get on with it. What are you after this time?He said he wanted a book on festival puns.I was sick out of it. Sick of his audacity and my empty wallet.

After much heated discussion, they eventually settled on Admiral Nelson to be the face of this new currency.Now, none of what I just told you is true in the slightest. Yet, there are still many people who swear they remember this moment of British history.

"Yoda and Luke are walking through the swamp. Part of their usual training course involves shimmying along a cliff ledge, but today, there’s a long break in the ledge they can’t cross...","“Something for this I have.” Yoda says. He reaches into his bag and takes out a bunch of regular dinner table forks and a roll of duct tape.He tapes several forks together to make a bridge and lays it down, allowing the two of them to get across.When they get back to Yoda’s hovel, they find that some creature has chewed a hole in the fence around Yoda’s garden.“Something I have for this.” Yoda says again. Once again, he takes a bunch of forks out of his bag and, using duct tape, tapes them in to patch the hole.Yoda and Luke return to Yoda’s home, where Yoda looks through his bag. He’s used all his forks but one, he discovers.“That’s ok Master."" Luke says, wanting to be helpful. “I’ll write us a note reminding us to buy more.”So he writes the note and uses the very last fork to pin it to the bulletin board.He looks down at Yoda expecting pride, but instead finds a look of horror.“Master Yoda!” he asks. “What did I do wrong?”Yoda replies sagely, “A Jedi uses the forks for no ledge and the fence. Never for a tack!”",5 months ago,304

After much heated discussion, they eventually settled on Admiral Nelson to be the face of this new currency.Now, none of what I just told you is true in the slightest.
