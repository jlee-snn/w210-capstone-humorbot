179," I play golf. I'm not good at golf, I never got good. I never got a hole-in-one. But I did hit a guy. And that's way more satisfying. You're supposed to yell ""Fore!"" but I was too busying mumbling ""There ain't no way that's gonna hit him."""
180," When you're in Hollywood and you're a comedian, everybody wants you to do other things besides comedy. They say ""All right you're a stand up comedian, can you act? Can you write? Write us a script."" They want me to do things that's related to comedy, but it's not comedy. That's not fair.

182," I was at a casino, I was standing by the door, and the security guard came over and he said ""You're gonna have to move. You're blocking the fire exit,"" as if though there was a fire, I wasn't gonna run. If you're flammable and have legs, you are never blocking a fire exit."

Not only does she not have arms, but she doesn't understand simple contractions."

200, I had a bag of Fritos. They were Texas Grilled Fritos. These Fritos had grill marks on them. Hell yeah! Reminds me of summer... when we used to fire up the barbecue... and throw down some Fritos.

213," I walked by a dry cleaner at 3am, the sign said ""Sorry we're closed."" You don't have to be sorry; it's 3am and you're a dry cleaner. It would be ridiculous for me to expect you to be open. I'm not gonna walk in at 10am and say ""Hey, I walked by at 3, you guys were closed. Somebody owes me an apology."""
214, I'm an ice sculptor. Last night I made a cube.
215," I got New Balance shoes on, but they're old... so I might start falling."
216, I like when they say shampoo is volumizing... because my hair is fuckin' quiet.
217, I wish they made fajita cologne... because that shit smells good.

241," I like when they say that a movie was ""inspired by a true story"" because that's weird. It means the movie is not true, it was just inspired by a true story.

I think we should adopt it. Because bears can be mean, but frogs are always cool. Never has there been a frog hopping toward me, and I thought ""Man, I'd better play dead. Here comes that frog."" I would never say ""Here comes that frog"" in a horrifying manner. It's always, like, optimistic. Like, ""Hey, here comes that frog, all right.
